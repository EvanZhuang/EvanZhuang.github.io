**Hey, I'm Yufan Zhuang (Â∫ÑÂÆáÂá°)!**

I'm a PhD student at UC San Diego advised by [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) working on making language models smarter and more versatile. I develop methods that push the boundaries of how AI systems understand and generate language‚Äîfrom helping them reason through complex, long-form content to enabling them to learn from any data modality.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on advancing natural language processing and large language models through:

**üîÑ Beyond Traditional Sampling**  
Exploring continuous mixture approaches for more nuanced LLM inference ([Mixture of Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14827))

**üìö Agentic Long Context**  
Improving long-context capabilities through agentic learning ([AgenticLU, ACL'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15920))

**üåê Cross-Modal ICL**  
Enabling models to learn from any modality in-context ([Vector-ICL, ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05629))

**üîç Model Evaluation**  
Studying cross-lingual data contamination in contemporary LLMs ([Deep Contamination, EMNLP'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13236))

I've also trained high quality Mamba-based vision language models ([ViperVLMs](https://huggingface.co/ViperVLM)), extending LLMs context length with adaptive wavelet transform ([WavSpa](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v243/zhuang24a/zhuang24a.pdf)), and a series of work on computational sociology [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2022.2042180). 

Prior to my PhD study, I worked at [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/yorktown-heights) as a research engineer helping to enhance software engineering with the power of AI and vice versa. I received my MS in Data Science from [Columbia](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), my BSc in Applied Math Minor in CS (with First Class Honors) from [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/).
