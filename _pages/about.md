**Hey, I'm Yufan Zhuang Â∫ÑÂÆáÂá°**

I'm a final year CS PhD student at UC San Diego advised by [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) working on **making language models reason better and more agentic**. I develop methods that push the boundaries of how AI systems understand and generate language‚Äîfrom helping them reason through complex problems, long-form content to enabling them to learn from any data modality in continuous space.

üëã I'm on the job market for full-time AI research positions starting Dec 2025.

### üîç **LLM Reasoning and Agentic Learning**
**Mixture of Inputs** ([NeurIPS'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14827)) - *Beyond Discrete Sampling*  
Exploring continuous mixture approaches that fundamentally improve how language models reason through complex problems by operating in continuous vector space rather than discrete tokens.

**Vector-ICL** ([ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05629)) - *Cross-Modal In-Context Learning*  
Enabling models to learn from any data modality in-context through continuous vector representations, breaking down traditional barriers between text, images, and other data types.

**AgenticLU** ([ACL'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15920)) - *Agentic Long Context Learning*  
Improving long-context capabilities through intelligent agentic approaches that can dynamically reason through complex, extended content with strategic planning.

**MetaTree** ([TMLR'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03774)) - *Tabular Data Processing with Transformers*  
Training transformers via meta-learning to directly produce strong decision trees, bridging classical ML algorithms with modern neural approaches for superior generalization.

### üìä **Post-training Model Evaluation**
**Deep Contamination** ([EMNLP'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13236)) - *Cross-lingual Data Contamination Study*  
Uncovering critical issues in how we evaluate contemporary LLMs, particularly around cross-lingual contamination that affects model reliability.

### üî¨ **AI for Software Engineering & Sociology**
**Signal-Aware Code Understanding** ([ACM TOSEM'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597202)) - *Trustworthy AI for Source Code*  
Developing signal-aware AI models for software vulnerability detection that focus on learning task-relevant source code features rather than spurious correlations, improving model robustness and reliability.

**Prediction-Preserving Input Minimization** ([ESEC/FSE'21](https://2021.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2021-papers/14/Probing-Model-Signal-Awareness-via-Prediction-Preserving-Input-Minimization)) - *Probing AI Model Understanding*  
Introducing P2IM approach to systematically evaluate AI models' signal awareness by reducing source code to minimal snippets needed to maintain predictions, revealing models' reliance on incorrect signals.

**Computational Social Science** ([Annals AAG'22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24694452.2022.2042180)) - *Machine Learning for Sociological Analysis*  
Applying machine learning approaches to decipher heterogeneous representations and images of Chinese communities in North America, bridging computational methods with sociological research.

Prior to my PhD study, I worked at [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/yorktown-heights) as a research engineer helping to enhance software engineering with the power of AI and vice versa. I received my MS in Data Science from [Columbia](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), my BSc in Applied Math Minor in CS (with First Class Honors) from [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/).
