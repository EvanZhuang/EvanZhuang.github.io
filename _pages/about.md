**Hey, I’m Yufan Zhuang (庄宇凡)!**

I am a PhD student in UCSD's Computer Science & Engineering department advised by [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). My research is centered on natural language processing and large language models.

I have proposed ways to in-context learn from any modality ([Vector-ICL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05629)), conducted studies on [cross-lingual data contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13236) for contemporary LLMs, made transformers effective meta algorithm learners for decision trees ([MetaTree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03774)). 

I've also trained first series of high quality Mamba-based vision language models ([ViperVLMs](https://huggingface.co/ViperVLM)), extending LLMs context length with adaptive wavelet transform ([WavSpa](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v243/zhuang24a/zhuang24a.pdf)), and a series of work on computational sociology [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2022.2042180). 

Prior to my PhD study, I worked at [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/yorktown-heights) as a research engineer helping to enhance software engineering with the power of AI and vice versa. I received my MS in Data Science from [Columbia](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), my BSc in Applied Math Minor in CS (with First Class Honors) from [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/).
